    <string name="history">
        In October 2003, well before the term “smartphone” was used by most of the public, and several years before Apple announced its first iPhone and its iOS, the company Android Inc was founded in Palo Alto, California. Its four founders were Rich Miner, Nick Sears, Chris White, and Andy Rubin. At the time of its public founding, Rubin was quoted as saying that Android Inc was going to develop “smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner’s location and preferences.”
        In 2005, the next big chapter in Android’s history was made when the original company was acquired by Google. Rubin and other founding members stayed on to continue to develop the OS under their new owners. The decision was made to use Linux as the basis for the Android OS, and that also meant that Android itself could be offered to third-party mobile phone manufacturers for free. Google and the Android team felt the company could make money offering other services that used the OS, including apps.
        Rubin stayed at Google as head of the Android team until 2013, when Google announced he would be leaving that division. In late 2014, Rubin left Google altogether and launched a startup business incubator. Earlier in 2017, Rubin officially revealed his return to the smartphone industry with his company’s announcement of the Android-based Essential Phone.</string>
    <string name="architectureinfo">
    Android is architected in the form of a software stack comprising applications, an operating system, run-time environment, middleware, services and libraries. This architecture can, perhaps, best be represented visually as outlined in Figure 6-1. Each layer of the stack, and the corresponding elements within each layer, are tightly integrated and carefully tuned to provide the optimal application development and execution environment for mobile devices.
</string>
    <string name="dalvik">
        As previously noted, the Linux kernel provides a multitasking execution environment allowing multiple processes to execute concurrently. It would be easy to assume, therefore, that each Android application simply runs as a process directly on the Linux kernel. In fact, each application running on an Android device does so within its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine (VM).

Running applications in virtual machines provides a number of advantages. Firstly, applications are essentially sandboxed, in that they cannot detrimentally interfere (intentionally or otherwise) with the operating system or other applications, nor can they directly access the device hardware. Secondly, this enforced level of abstraction makes applications platform neutral in that they are never tied to any specific hardware.

The Dalvik virtual machine was developed by Google and relies on the underlying Linux kernel for low-level functionality. It is more efficient than the standard Java VM in terms of memory usage, and specifically designed to allow multiple instances to run efficiently within the resource constraints of a mobile device.

In order to execute within a Dalvik VM, application code must be transformed from standard Java class files to the Dalvik executable (.dex) format, which has a 50% smaller memory footprint than standard Java bytecode. Standard Java class files can usually (though not always) be converted to Dex format using the dx tool included with the Android SDK.
    </string>
    <string name="linuxkernel">Positioned at the bottom of the Android software stack, the Linux Kernel provides a level of abstraction between the device
        hardware and the upper layers of the Android software stack. Based on Linux version 2.6, the kernel provides preemptive multitasking, low-level core system services such as memory, process and power management in addition to providing a network stack and device drivers for hardware such as the device display, Wi-Fi and audio.

The original Linux kernel was developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds and was combined with a set of tools, utilities and compilers developed by Richard Stallman at the Free Software Foundation to create a full operating system referred to as GNU/Linux. Various Linux distributions have been derived from these basic underpinnings such as Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

It is important to note, however, that Android only uses the Linux kernel. That said, it is worth noting that the Linux kernel was originally developed for use in traditional computers in the form of desktops and servers. In fact, Linux is now most widely deployed in mission critical enterprise server environments. It is a testament to both the power of today’s mobile devices and the efficiency and performance of the Linux kernel that we find this software at the heart of the Android software stack. </string>
